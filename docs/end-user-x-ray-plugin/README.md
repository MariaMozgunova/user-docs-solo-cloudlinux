# End-user X-Ray plugin

The end-user X-Ray plugin is enabled by default on CloudLinux OS Solo.

## How to manage the end-user X-Ray plugin

The web interface of the end-user X-Ray plugin is almost the same as the X-Ray administrator interface.

But there are some differences and they are described further.

* End-users can create tasks only for their domains from the drop-down list:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIStart.png)
* To specify URL or wildcard, end-users should use the input field next to the domain:
    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUiSpecifyURL.png)
 

:::warning Note
Tracing tasks created by an end-user will also be displayed in the administrator interface and administrators can manage the end-user's tasks the same way as they manage their own. At the same time, tasks created by the administrator or other end-users will not be displayed in the UI of the current user.

## End-user X-Ray plugin limitations

* The end-user X-Ray plugin does not support creating continuous tasks.
* The administrator and the end-user can’t run the tracing task for the same Domain/URL at the same time. Once the administrator started a specific tracing task, the end-user will not be able to duplicate it. And the same is true for the administrators – they will just see the running task for the specific domain and see the notification that they're trying to create a tracing task with a duplicated URL.
* If continuous tracing is enabled for the domain, the end-user will not be able to create a new task for this domain because the same rule works - it will be a duplicate of the existing tracing tasks. The next warning will appear:

    ![](/images/XRayEndUserUIWarning.png)

    To solve this, the existing running tasks for the same Domain/URL should be stopped or completed. You can find more details about this in the [FAQ](https://docs.solo.cloudlinux.com/manager/#what-should-i-do-if-i-see-the-warning-task-is-duplicated-by-url).
